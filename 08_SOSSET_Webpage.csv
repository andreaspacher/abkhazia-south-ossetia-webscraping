Q:  Just several hours later after she was elected as the President of Georgia Mrs. Zurabishvili has stated that it’s not the time to speak with Russia and immediately reloaded the theme of Russian occupation. How can you comment on that?
A:  Definitely, these elections are an internal affair of Georgia and have nothing to do with our Republic. As for the question, hardly did anyone expect more “original” comment on that issue of her … In short time after the elections a noted signal has been sent to the Western partners as well as to Russia. On the other hand that signal is also good for internal use. And maybe this statement would ease the burden of expenses for the sponsors of the mega-budget project “democratic elections in Georgia” as well…

Pertaining to the 10th anniversary of Georgian military aggression against South Ossetia
Over a long period of time South Ossetia has been the object of the predatory aspirations of the Georgian authorities. Since proclamation of the Georgian independence each new leader considered it his duty to start military actions, ethnic cleansings or genocides against the Ossetian people. Many thousands of the Ossetians were killed and massacred as a result of that. The genocides of the Ossetian people in 1920, 1989-1992, the military invasion in 2004 and, finally, the Georgian-Ossetian war in August 2008, in which the military confrontation culminated, left deep open wounds in hearts of the Ossetian people.

Q: - The Catalan referendum for secession from Spain was held on October 1, 2017. What can you say about this event?
A:  - Today the Catalan citizens like we in South Ossetia in early 1990-s have been defending and fighting for the fundamental and the most often declared European value – the right of the people for self-determination. Despite the police riots, it is obvious that the Catalans have honorably asserted their right to independence! The aggressive response of Spanish authorities to the referendum once again has shown to the world that not the rule of fundamental principles of international law, but double standards and barefaced hypocrisy has become the practice in the West. Having recognized the independence of Kosovo by rejection of a part of the Serbian territory, the so-called guardians of democracy have strongly opposed self-determination of the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. And when the people of South Ossetia were exposed to ethnic cleansings by Georgia when they had been asserting the right to independence, nobody in the West condemned the actions of Georgia.

- Mr. Medoev, 9 years have passed since the recognition of the independence of South Ossetia by Russia. What has been done for the international recognition of South Ossetia throughout these years? What are your plans for the nearest future? 
- Indeed, August 26, 2017 saw celebration of another anniversary of the recognition of the Republic of South Ossetia by the Russian Federation. This day is very important for us. After those August days Georgia has ceased its any attempts to force us to obey Tbilisi’s will. The peace has come, and it is the main success of all that campaign. Saakashvili's regime put an end to the peaceful process on August 8, 2008. And since this date the internationally accepted term “Georgian-Ossetian conflict” has ceased to exist, as well as the associated term “settlement"".

Вопрос: August 18 saw Ian Kelly, the US Ambassador to Georgia, visiting Ergneti, a Georgian village adjacent to the border with the Republic of South Ossetia, where he claimed that “occupation will not last, that barbed wire will not stand”. How can you comment on that?
Ответ: The statements of the US Ambassador made about the state border of the Republic of South Ossetia looks like the last desperate attempt of Georgian mentors to bring hope for restoration of the mythical territorial integrity of Georgia. However, that traditional performance resembled all previous prearranged actions, organized near the state border, but with one difference – this time services of the elderly grandfather were not necessary for the organizers.

— Mr. Medoev, did you expect your appointment as the Minister of Foreign Affairs or in other words, was there any agreement between you and the President during the presidential campaign?
— I had no agreements either with the President or with anyone from his team. I purposefully participated in the election campaign as a member of a presidential candidate’s team. Positions and career were the least of my concerns – one had to be result-orientated and thus we gained a fair and merited success. It was a natural decision for me, as there is no secret that yet in 2011 I supported this candidate and even today I believe that unless the famous events disrupt the electors’ choice, it would have been Anatoliy Bibilolov, who would have become the President. Neither before, nor later have I changed my political orientation. I have always considered upholding national interests as the main thing in my work.

The decision that was made by the European Parliament on February 2 about provision of visa-free regime to Georgia has caused a boundless euphoria among Georgian authority, which began to offer these benefits to “those citizens of Georgia who live in territories that are not controlled by Georgian central government – in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali region”.

Couldn't but draw attention to the latest attempts to define “the status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia” once again undertaken in Georgia. This time the issue of their “special status as part of Georgia” was discussed by a constitutional commission of the neighboring state.
The absurd idea about a possibility of a certain “reintegration” and coexistence of South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Georgia within one state is imposed on Georgian society with a persistence that deserves better application.

Q: Could you please comment on the situation around conditions of the arrival of Julietto Kieza, a famous Italian journalist and political figure, to the Republic of South Ossetia. 
A: That’s right. Upon invitation from one of the political parties of the Republic, Mr. Kieza arrived to Tskhinval on January 23, 2017. Unfortunately, he faced certain problems while crossing the state border of the Republic of South Ossetia, as the receiving party had ignored the legal requirements pertaining to the entry procedures for foreign citizens arriving to the Republic of South Ossetia. The problem was solved rather fast, however the hosting party didn’t miss out the opportunity and tried to overblow a political scandal and shuffle off the responsibility for consequences of an incident that became a result of disrespect for the legislation of your own country to the MFA.

They resulted in 16 victims and 34 injured who received wounds of varying severity and even became invalids.

- Four citizens of the Republic of South Ossetia returned to their homes after 11-year imprisonment in Georgia. What work has been done these 11 years and what attempts has been made to release our citizens? 
- Indeed, difficult 11 years have our citizens spent in Georgian prisons. All these years we in South Ossetia were claiming that those detentions and imprisonments had been unlawful and insisted on release. This issue was regularly raised by South Ossetia representatives within the Joint Control Committee (JCC) and at other levels. However due to the unconstructive position of Georgian party and non-availability to solute even those problems that are humanitarian, non-political, there were no serious progress on this front. Therefore I would like to express gratitude for the efforts made by our public representatives in general and by Lira Kozeva in particular. They were engaged in this case and sometimes have gained even better results than those achieved by officials of the Republic due to the non-governmental character of activity. In particular, they helped in organizing meetings between relatives of the detainees and officials and in transmitting applications to Georgian governmental agencies.

On state border line denotation 
Georgian diplomacy is making titanic efforts to find direct or indirect support for their claims on territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Western sponsors of Georgia express solidarity with Tbilisi one in a while to support their protégé. Georgia is especially concerned with works carried out by South Ossetia on denotation of the state border line. However, Georgia was able to rush its interpretation of the situation at some of the European venues to expressed ‘concerns’ about ‘installation of barbed-wire’, ‘restriction of freedom of movement’ that was presented in Tbilisi as success Georgian diplomacy.
Meanwhile the reality is that there are no diplomatic relations between South Ossetia and Georgia, therefore, there are no agreements that regulate border crossing. South Ossetia is a sovereign state, the border regime, its denotation and arrangement is regulated by legislation of Republic of South Ossetia.
In the frame of the Agreement between Republic of South Ossetia and Russian Federation on joint efforts for protection of the state border, protection of state border is jointly done by South Ossetian and Russian border guards. 
All the attempts of Georgia to dictate South Ossetia its position are hopeless. It would have been much better for future of Georgia to follow the example of Russia and negotiate with Republic of South Ossetia delimitation and demarcation of the border line instead of looking for support in Strasburg and Vienna.
It should be noted that attempts to interfere into internal affairs of South Ossetia, a sovereign state, are hopeless. At the same time we confirm our committal to norm and fundamental principals of the International Law and count on their observance by all parties of the International Community.

- During the summit on Eastern partnership in Vilnius, Georgia initialed agreement on association with the EU, final signing is planned for next year but they already announced plans on economic involvement of South Ossetia and Abkhazia into joint projects between European Union and Georgia. Above that, during the last year and a half, particularly after assumption of office by the Georgian Dream, representatives of international organizations and some politically committed Russian experts more and more often find it necessary to depoliticize issues between RSO and Georgia and start rebuilding relations in economic and humanitarian spheres. How is South Ossetia going to build its foreign policy, considering these factors, and how South Ossetia is going to react on the attempts of its involvement into economic and humanitarian projects with Georgia? 
- We never had doubts that Georgia would not change its strategic direction and goals in respect of South Ossetia. They of course use all available leverages that to captivate RSO and place it under command by all means.

Question: How do you estimate the decision of the International UN Court pertaining the Kosovo status problem?Answer. Notwithstanding the fact that decision of International UN Court is of consultative character, it creates certain internationally legal precedent. It is crucially important to underline, that the court marked only the Declaration of proclamation of independence itself. However, on my opinion, this decision may be considered as an indirect recognition of Kosovo independence, what will push other states to its recognition.
